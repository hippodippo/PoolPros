# Pool Pros 2.0
-------------------

## Things that I used this time:
- Container / Component pattern ( and Pages )
  ( Containers handle data / logic and pass data to Components )
  ( Pages assemble their containers to make up a complete page. )
  ( Pages contain --> Containers contain --> Components )
- npm scripts ( Testing, Linting, etc. )
- Flow ( Static Type Checking )
- React Router
- Axios
- Express
- Webpack
- Babel
- Jest ( Tests )
- Enzyme ( Tests )
- ESLint
- Sass
- BEM ( Block Element Modifier )
- HTML5 ( Semantic ) ( HTML forms ;) )
- Normalize.css ( provides consistency between browsers )
- ( Babel, Jest, and ESLint configurations can be found in package.json )
- ( Fonts can be found in the index.scss file located inside the styles folder )

## How am I getting the data?
I am pulling the data from a basic server that gives us the JSON data that you provided in the FED folder.
We fetch the data in the "FindProPage" Page Component located at src/pages/FindProPage/FindProPage.js

## P.S. Anything else I need to learn, I more than happy to dive right in :)
